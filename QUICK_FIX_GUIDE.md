# üöÄ Quick Fix: Add Sample Data to Backend

## Option 1: Quick Demo with Sample Data (Recommended)
The easiest way to get your frontend working immediately:

### Step 1: Run Sample Data Script Locally
```bash
cd india-music-insights
python add_sample_data.py
```

### Step 2: Check Local Database
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# Test: http://localhost:8000/v1/charts/top-today?market=IN
```

### Step 3: Deploy Sample Database to Railway
If the local version works with sample data, you can:
1. Copy the database file to Railway
2. Or modify the script to run on Railway
3. Or use Railway's database with sample data

## Option 2: Full Spotify Integration (More Complex)
1. Set up Spotify Developer Account
2. Get API credentials  
3. Configure Railway environment variables
4. Run data ingestion

## Immediate Fix for Testing
Let's create a simple API mock or use the sample data approach to get your frontend working while you set up Spotify API credentials.

## Testing Your Current Setup
Your endpoints are working, they just return empty data:
- ‚úÖ `/v1/analytics/overview` - Returns zeros (no data)
- ‚ùå `/v1/charts/top-today` - Fails (needs data)
- ‚ùå `/v1/analytics/genres` - Fails (needs data)

The frontend is correctly calling the right endpoints, they just need data!
